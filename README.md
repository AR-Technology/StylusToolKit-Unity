## What is the Stylus Toolkit?
The Stylus Toolkit is a collection of scripts and components intended to accelerate development of applications targeting the new 3D input device Stylus XR for head-mounted units. Stylus XR works as interaction and creation tool in Mixed Reality with yet unmatched precision and was developed by AR Technology in cooperation with Holo-Light. Currently Stylus Toolkit supports the creation of Mixed Reality applications for Microsoft HoloLens 2 with Unity 3D.
